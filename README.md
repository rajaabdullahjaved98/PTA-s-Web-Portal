# PTA-s-Web-Portal
A project for creating a web portal for making it easier for the employees to update, share and create spreadsheets on a centralized database.
This project was assigned to me by my supervisor during my internship once I told him that I have a passion for pursuing a career in Web Development.
There were a lot of folders and files so I merged all of it in a .rar file.
